		The taxonomy of the extra terms to associate to each imported post. Default "post_tag"
		
	[--extra-terms=<terms>]
		Comma-separated list of terms to associate to each imported post. If you want to enter terms of a hierarchical taxonomy like
     categories, then use IDs. If you want to add non-hierarchical terms like tags, then use names.
